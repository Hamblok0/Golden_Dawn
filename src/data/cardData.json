    "shortDescription": "The positive break up of structures and limitations, selfless idealism, endless fantasy, optimism, trust to instincts. The negative loss of structures, responsivelessness, useless daydreaming, infantility",
    "longDescription": "In spiritual matters, the Fool means idea, thought, spirituality, that which endeavors to transcend earth. In material matters, it may, if badly dignified, mean folly, eccentricity, or even mania. But the essential of this card is that is represents an original, subtle, sudden impulse or impact, coming from a completely strange quarter. All such impulses are right, if rightly received; and the good or ill interpretation of the card depends entirely on the right attitude of the Querent"

    "shortDescription": "Self-realization, a strong will, the energy to have one's way, activity, power of life, impulse, energy. Aggressivity, egoism, the abuse of power",
    "longDescription": "The Magician represents consciousness, action and creation. He's the symbol for the idea of manifestation - the possibility of making an idea come true. He gives meaning and direction to life, and he reminds us that the emotional and creative powers of our souls must have a physical basis to be of real use. Powers unused are powers non-existant, we have to set them free in order to use them, and to gain and renew. The Magician shows that we're aware of the power in life, he can be a symbol for all the creative skills and ideas inside. Most people don't really act, they just react, being driven from one situation to the next. The Magician tells that a power is ready to use as soon as it is recognized, to see and go the own way."

    "shortDescription": "The desire to find the inner sources, being one with the beginning of all, aware of the wisdom from the subconscious, intuitive knowledge. Changing moods, doubts, igoring reality.",
    "longDescription": "Pure, exalted and gracious influence enters the matter. Hence, change, alternation, increase and decrease, fluctuation. There is, however, a liability to be led away by enthusiasm; one may become moon-struck unless careful balance in maintained. As a symbol for deeper knowledge, the card can express a feeling of darkness, which might also be a feeling of fear, but also a feeling of beauty. We know there is more inside than we can see."

    "shortDescription": "Love, beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, completion, good fortune, graciousness, elegance, luxury, friendship. Greed, envy, jealousy, laziness, debauchery.",
    "longDescription": "The Empress is the friendlier, more approachable aspect of the female archetype. She stands for maternity, love and mercy; at the same time she's a symbol for sexuality and emotion. She is pure feeling, absolutely unintellectual, but basically life. The Empress is the Great Mother, representing the beginning of all life. She is the power of nature, causing change, renewal, major plans. The Empress also stands for passion, a phase in which we cope life on an emotional and joyful basis, rather than on the thoughtful. This could mean great satisfaction, but in a improper context, when actually more analysis is needed. The Empress can also stand for a reflective, emotional attitude, refusing to accept reality. It also could stand for a person who is greedy for joy and abundance when actually just more self-control is needed."

    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Conquest, victory, ambition, originality, energy, vigour. War, strife, megalomania, quarrelsomeness, stubbornness, impracticality",
    "longDescription": "Just as the Empress stands for Mother Nature, the Emperor is the social word, the structure of civilization, a symbol for its law and order, may they be good or bad, but the power behind them. He is the abstraction of establishment, its stability and security. In its negative aspects the card can represent the force of bad law in a society where stability is rated higher than morals or ethic. Once law and order are established as an institution, a bad emperor can turn out to be a disaster. And even at his best the Emperor is limited; he puts restrictions and borders to the spontanity of spirit and nature."

    "shortDescription": "Endurance, placidity, manifestation, patience, organization, help from superiors. Toil, stubborn strength, intolerance, esoteric nonsense",
    "longDescription": "The Hierophant is a symbol for a world of belief and confession, may it be a church, a sect or an occult society. He's the pope, the druid or the High Priest in a system of creeds and dogmas. He represents the religious and intellectual tradition of a person, and may be the one the person is born to it or possibly the one who has chosen it by himself. In the positive aspect, the Hierophant represents the search for knowledge and illumination, the desire to study creed and dogma instead of simply accepting them, to research and achieve further development. In a negative view, the Hierophant can stand for bigotry, the blind faith in dogma, intolerance towards everything different from the own confession."

    "shortDescription": "Full hearted confession, trust, optimism, devotion, being one with it. Displacement, repression, giving up on one's self, childishness, indecision",
    "longDescription": "The Lovers are one of the most complex cards in the Major Arcana, standing for the love in common and the alchemy of the universe. The trump represents the power of life, the creative love, which can be quite impressive, but also destructive when one happens to disregard the fire of instinct, burning down rationalism. The card also represents a decision, the farewell to a former way of life and the full acceptance of love uncompromising. It doesn't necessarily mean that the 'love' is a person that you tie your knots to with fancy tungsten wedding bands, it can be a passion, a desire, or even a profession."

    "element": "Water",
    "shortDescription": "Triumph, memory, hope, digestion, obedience, faithfulness, courage. Ruthlessness, lust of destruction, violence in maintaining traditional ideas",
    "longDescription": "The Chariot stands for combined powers, ready to move forward. It represents the dynamic principle and the human will to proceed, the ability to use the powers of life and keep the outer and inner balance. The Chariot shows a strong will, a strong personality, and at its best, victory and success. But it also is a symbol for controversial power, for contradictions that are not solved, but just controlled. In this, the trump also warns of overestimation and recklessness. With every new venture or beginning one should check carefully whether the desired goal is compatible with one's life and inner self."    
  },
  "t-8": {
    "name": "Adjustment",
    "element": "Air",
    "shortDescription": "Justice, the act of adjustment, suspension of all action pending decision, treaties, marriage.",
    "longDescription": "The Adjustment is a symbol for the balance of contrasts, complementing one another and also building up room and time. She combines the High Priestess and the Magician. Both are connected; true, conscious action results from realization, wisdom is based on action. The principle of activity completes itself with the passivity of inner reflection, the adjustment being the balance in between. Another common name of this trump is 'Justice'; the card tells one to be righteous in all aspects of our life, to ignore, surpress or prefer none if need be. Only when we have an objective view of all and accept them, can we can find inner balance and silence."

    "name": "The Hermit",
    "element": "Earth",
    "shortDescription": "Illumination from within, practical plans derived accordingly, secret impulse from within, retirement from participation. Loneliness, bitterness, numbness, self isolation",
    "longDescription": "The Hermit represents retirement from the outside world, introversion into the inner self, listening to the inner voice and caring for the inner self. He requires retreat from any 'high life' and loud company, and stands for a time of self-reflection and self-realization. For most people, the silent loneliness of the Hermit appears unattractive, but behind the Hermit is the wisdom of the High Priestess. You cannot listen to your inner voices while having a party. In its negative aspect, the Hermit could mean being afraid of others or of life. When the retreat turns out to be a runaway, the loneliness can turn into a jail."

    "name": "Fortune",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Unexpected changes, realization of luck, fortune. Fatalism, a change for the worse.",
    "longDescription": "Fortune is a symbol of destiny and destination, of good luck and bad luck, of the ups and downs of life and fate. Everything is in motion, turning and floating, constantly changing, accidental and uncontrollable. The trump also represents the need to be careful, to realize and recognize the vaguarities of life, to accept the fact that fate is nothing what we could have done, but the result of what we already did. Today is the result of the past, future will be the sum of past and today, and no matter how accurately we plan, Fortune will mix up light and shadow. Whether Fortune is positive or negative is not a matter of happenstance or events in the first place; but rather of the way we will deal with the results, arrange our lives with the unchangable and work on what we might be able to change, and, of course of our ability to realize facts."

    "name": "Lust",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Power, vitality, charisma, joy of life, courage, energy and action, exorbitant passion. Weakness, dissatisfaction, self repression",
    "longDescription": "Lust is the step into the second decade of the Major Arcana, the point where the journey into the inner depth begins. In other decks, this trump is called 'The Power', a symbol for the mastery of our own animal side. Crowley named the card 'Lust', and most people don't really think of mastering their inner animal, but enjoy it full tilt. In a combination of both, the animal side shouldn't be 'mastered' in the meaning of 'surpressed', nor should it be let out to 'romp around'. It should not be ignored, but accepted as a natural part of oneself. In that manner, one will not only be able to profit from its instinctive natural power, but also to save the power needed to 'master' it. The Passion implies vitality, energy and power. The card tells us to use these riches. In most aspects of life, an endeavor will have much more success when passion is put into it."

  "t-12": {
    "name": "The Hanged Man",
    "element": "Water",
    "shortDescription": "Enforced sacrifice, overcoming ego, new perspective, acceptance of fate. Penishment, loss, suffering, defeat, failure, death.",
    "longDescription": "The Hanged Man is a symbol for the turning points in life, showing up a need to stop and assess a situation. We're hanging in the air until we find a new view of the things around us, a proper way to rearrange or restart. But the Hanged Man is a 'silent' card, there's no pressing need for change. No big change is waltzing towards us, we can peacefully keep on hanging and complaining. The Hanged Man just shows that we're just 'hanging', he requires a new viewpoint, and sometimes a lot of patience. In its positive aspect, the card shows the need for a time of consideration, the forced relaxation gives the opportunity to relax and reflect, to sort thoughts and ideas and find a new way to cope with a situation."
  },
  "t-13": {
    "name": "Death",
    "element": "Water",
    "shortDescription": "Transformation, change, voluntary or involuntary, logical development of existing conditions. Fear of loss, destruction, rejection of change.",
    "longDescription": "There hardly is a card provoking so many 'oops' in a reading; never forget that the Death is meant as an archetype, a symbol. Death represents the neverending circle of death and rebirth as the precondition for new life and creation, for life is permanently changing, hello and goodbye, leaving and arriving. The Death will show that something has ended and something will begin, and doesn't care if the end is painful and the new beginning welcomed or vice versa. The card implies the need to let something go, and requires the understanding of the circles of life. The negative aspect of the card could plainly mean that we want to keep what we have to give up, that no change is welcome. In most cases it is just a refusal to understand and accept. It can mean we are scared of loss and also afraid to restart."

  "t-14": {
    "name": "Art",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Combination of forces, realization, action based on accurate calculation, a way of escape, success after elaborate maneuvers. Extremism, splitting apart.",
    "longDescription": "Art represents the art of alchemy, the ability to solve and combine, to turn something plain into something precious. Art is the symbol for the right mixture, the perfect balance, standing for harmony, beauty and peace. But the trump can also show that sides that were previously ignored should be lived out and that contrasts should be put together to enrich the inner spectrum with new perspectives. From a personal view the 'solve et coagula' can mean that there is a need to leave a fixed position, to retire, watch and then go back again to combine on a new basis."
  },
  "t-15": {
    "name": "The Devil",
    "element": "Earth",
    "shortDescription": "Independence, rejection of established dogma, ambition, obsession, hard work. Obstinancy, rigidity, aching discontent, blind impulse",
    "longDescription": "Reducing the long story of the Devil to its roots, there was an archangel called Lucifer (lightbringer) who said 'I'm born to be free - I don't serve!'. Later on there was a despotic religion that annihilated everything else, destroyed age old cultures and beliefs, and surpressed natural wisdom and science. Then, the world was provided with perverted rags like Dantes' 'Divine Comedy', while everything scientific landed in the fire. But for all the 'evil' there was a perfect scapegoat; the devil. In the Tree of Life the Devil goes from consciousness and harmony to intellect and logic - against all dogma, never caring for rules, freely uncompromising and independent. There are no restrictions, no limitations, nothing is forbidden. The Devil is aware of the darkness, he knows all the shadows and will go on researching even at a high price."
  },
  "t-16": {
    "name": "The Tower",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Sudden realization of the truth, the will to change old ways, getting rid of obsolete beliefs. Quarrel, combat, danger, ruin, destruction of plans.",
    "longDescription": "The Tower is a symbol of endurance and its destruction, an allusion to sudden, maybe shocking realizations that crushes old views and persuasions, maybe the view of the whole world. The area of relative security starts wavering, our tower then falls and with it the walls around us that have become too narrow. It is rarely the evil, but rather the necessary development we meet when there is a change in the armor of destruction. So in the positive aspect, this most violent trump will mean that we proceed to learn that losing the old secure fortress of our beliefs will reward us with a major step forward."
  },
  "t-17": {
    "name": "The Star",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Hope, unexpected help, clearness of vision, realization of possibilities. Error of judgment, excessive day dreaming, disappointment, illusions.",
    "longDescription": "The Star is the trump of hope and trust, for the sensitive understanding of cosmic coherence, the intuition that everything is in balance and harmony. It is related to the Adjustment (the cross sum of 17 is 8), but while the Adjustment keeps the balance deliberately, the Star keeps it with feeling. The Star is also called the 'Guiding Light', and is taken as a symbol of the deep realization that the chosen way is the right one, that the end of this way will be a good one, and that there is perfect harmony between the psychical feeling and the physical doing. In a negative position the Star can tell when there is a mistake in the code, some error in our feeling, that the way we feel so sure about isn't quite right. This is what makes this trump so kind - even in its most negative aspect it just gives us a gentle warning."
  },
  "t-18": {
    "name": "The Moon",
    "element": "Water",
    "shortDescription": "The brink of an important change, deepest self realization, wisdom, maturity. Hysteria, fear, madness, falsehood.",
    "longDescription": "The Moon will lead us into the blackest depths of our soul, into the world of the subconscious, where there are no more words, just images and notions. It represents a journey into the darkest night, a look behind our own face. The Moon isn't the most comfortable trump, though, everybody likes to equate it with the mysteries, rarely someone really enjoys the look into their own abyss, where sometimes the unvarnished truth is not too pleasant. Embarrassingly enough, the Moon tends to show up what we generally ignore, refuse to see, or even deny all the time. Unlike most trumps, the Moon has no real negative aspect, but it implies a serious danger. The journey into night could be too much when we're not prepared and we might get lost in our own shadow."

    "name": "The Sun",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Glory, triumph, pleasure, truth, shamelessness, self-confidence. Arrogance, vanity, promising yet doing nothing.",
    "longDescription": "The Sun is the symbol of life and light, for the power that always is generously given without reducing itself. The Sun will shine and give light to the earth to make all life possible. So the Sun stands for vitality and optimism, the blossoming of our nature, and is a sign that we have overcome the time of darkness and are ready to enjoy the light. But the Sun also has its negative aspects. Never forget that without the depth of water, the sun will create a desert."
  },
  "t-20": {
    "name": "The Aeon",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "The taking of a definite step, final decision in respect of the past, the new future, liberation of hidden abilities.",
    "longDescription": "The Aeon is the trump of time and the changes dictated by the times, it addresses finality and destruction as well as liberation, hope and redemption. The Aeon is the symbol for the Rise of Phoenix, it stands for a time of insight, the true understanding of the circle of life, of growing and fading. The card tells us that we should leave our 'frog perspective' and watch the things from a higher level, that the time has come to face the new, that we need a good overview to build our 'Utopia'. In older decks the Aeon is called 'Judgment', dealing with resurrection and redemption. The limitation of this view is the involuntary association to a 'court of law', to the Christian concept of a 'Resurrection' where the pious may rise and the rest must burn. "

  "t-21": {
    "name": "The Universe",
    "element": "Earth",
    "shortDescription": "Synthesis, the end of the matter, patience, perserverance, crystallization. Obstinancy, opposition, delay, false visions.",
    "longDescription": "The Universe as the end and completion of the Major Arcana is the symbol for the zenith of development, the achieved goal. The work is done or will soon be and we have found our place in life or will soon do so. Seeing the second decade of the Major Arcana as a way of self-realization, the Universe becomes the crown and the end. The Death was the rebirth, the Art the beginning of the alchemic work, the Devil the overcoming of restrictions, the Tower the breakdown of the jail. We followed the Star, explored the Moon, found the Sun and watched the Phoenix rise from the ashes. Finally, we touched the Universe. On a more practical level the Universe implies the good news that a goal has been achieved, or a success sure to come, and that a venture will flourish. In its negative aspect the trump can tell us that we are running after false ideas, that our way leads nowhere, that it is far too early to reach out for the Universe for there's substantial work that has yet to be done."

    "longDescription": "Like all Aces, the Ace of Wands symbolizes the roots and the entity of its element, here it is the root of Fire, the first spark to create the flaming powers of Atziluth, the world of the all-encompassing spiritual substance. Being the essence of Fire, the Ace itself goes nowhere, but stands for the strong feeling that soon might turn into a strong will or plan. There is a spiritual power that has the ability to grow, it is completely up to us whether we use it or not. The Ace of Wands might turn out to be bad when we cannot control or use its power that starts burning all out of a sudden, and all its riches get burned down before we can use them for good."

    "longDescription": "The power of energy that is born in the Ace is given direction and a goal in the Two of Wands. Chokmah as the power of creation and energy is the best possible surrounding for the flaming forces, the first manifestation following the pure idea, the beginning of transformation. Yet the card is not talking of consideration, let alone any cares. It comes up strong and recklessly, a wonderful thing when guiding at one good goal or project. Nevertheless, one should take at least a bit care that those wonderful powers won't crush anything around to pieces."

    "longDescription": "The Three's are connected to Binah - the understanding. The untouched energies of the Two's have met the 3, the number of synthesis and harmony. They're no longer solitudes, they face up their meanings and surroundings. The Three of Wands is called 'Virtue' - the powerful fire understands its responsibilty. The Three of Wands shows the powers of the element guided by understanding and awareness, the perfect precondition to begin a work or a project, to go ahead with a plan."

    "longDescription": "The Four of Wands represents Chesed - the power of condensation, growth and stability, standing in the structural discipline of the 4 - the work is done, the plan was successful, the Fire has settled and reigns over its realms. Fire is the element that stands for Atziluth, the world closest to divinity, and though the card might talk of every possible endeavour - a job, a relationship, an intellectual research, it is most likely aiming at something more spiritual. This explains the upcoming of the card in such seemingly inappropriate situations like big family troubles or failed business projects - hereby the card shows us that we've learned a lesson and that the failure in the 'profane' world was just what we needed to achieve more spiritual maturity."

    "longDescription": "Like all Fives, the Five of Wands stands for Geburah - motion and changing and the powers of destruction - and 5 is the number that breaks the stability and structure of the Four. Fire isn't meant for settling and resting, and the flames burn high to break out of their own realm of the Four. This means revolutionary movements and aggressive renewals, and sometimes this isn't the most pleasant way to go. Especially not when we felt good and comfortable in the secure structure of the Four. In the shadowy aspect, the violent disruption of the struggling flames can mean that we're just agressive and restless, making trouble for no better reason than being bored."

In the middle of the Tree of Life, right in the beauty and harmony of Tiphareth, the flames of the fire appear like pure floating gold. The Six of Wands shows that all the past troubles and disruptions have been necessary to grow and develop, and the victory we have now is more than just a gain by lucky chance. We have deserved it."

And like for all the Seven's, the leaving of the beautiful Tiphareth comes like the fall from paradise. But Fire is a fighter, and though the element seems to be burning down, it will struggle to survive. So the Seven of Wands talks of a situation where we have to face up forces stronger than ourself, situations that at first sight seem hopeless, yet we'll have to use all that we've learned and fight."

Swiftness is what is demanded in here, decisive action in high speed modus. The card can stand for sudden realizations, quick brainwaves, it can tell that the solution for a problem is already there or soon to come. It also reminds us that the spirit needs freedom to fly for otherwise it won't work at its best. The shadow side of the card can mean that we waste too much time with disputing and all kinds of tidbits, instead of moving quick and decisively. In another aspect of course it the size of the dose that makes the poison effective - if we rush it too much we'll end up with a mass of particles that won't do us any good."

Thus the Nine of Wands remembers the own qualities, showing the full powers of the fiery element rising again.

Fire is not made to rest on the grounds, having lost the contact to the higher levels of spirit, it mutates to a blind and cruel force , not understanding the own self anymore. Fire is a power that has to be handled with imagination and reflection, not with stubborness and hardened standards. To understand the card, you have to understand the qualities of the Wands which stand for Chiah, the general living spark, the vitality of soul.

He is the born leader, full of ideas and idealism, proud and commanding, at his best noble, honest, conscientous and intelligent. For Atziluth is the highest of the worlds and Fire the highest of the elements, the Knight of Wands can stand for highest inspirations, spiritual realisation and purest creativity. But with fire in fire, the Knight of the Wands lacks the depths of waters, the stability of earth and the analyzing logic of air. His strength might degenerate to pure tyranny, his convictions stiffen to dogmatism, he might get cruel, bigot and brutal at his worst. Further the fires within fire lack the sources of reserved potentials, so once the explosion is over, there is nothing more left for the Knight to provide."

As a queen, she is the mother of her element, the emotion and the sensitivity, thus having her attributes of love, understanding and sympathy, her abilities to form and create, spending trust and warmth. The fiery character provides pride, passion, inspiration and powerful independence, her charisma, strength and expansiveness. Due to the imbalance in her character, the Queen of Wands can easily shift to her dark side, becoming a hot-tempered, revengeful fury, overdominant and possessive, taking the tiniest bit as a reason to bear an grudge for years. She never forgets and never forgives, and as easily her fiery temper makes her forget own mistakes, so deeply her watery depths can cause her to ponder long and broad about the mistakes of others."

As the son of the Queen, he bears a certain heritage of the waters inside of him, expressing in romantical beliefs and a most generous nature. Though, the attributes of fire are excessively strong, combined with the flying airs the first impression is that of a hot storm, filled with action and wilful, impulsive energies. Lacking the patience of the earth, the Prince of Wands wants it all and he wants it now, refusements or delays might provoke explosive outbursts. He has endless courage and tenacity, he can fight far superior forces until he has won. With the airs whirled up by the hot breath of fire, he can be a juggler and trickster, wanton and frolic, recklessly abusing the powers of his mind to fool and ridicule the slow and harmless. He doesn't mean bad but usually storms forward too fast to recognize the ruins left behind. At the shadowy side, all his attributes can exaggerate to their worst, resulting in reckless destruction and even in cruelty and sadism. His impatience can mount into instability, always seeking for novelty without getting anything done, with all his powers burning out unused."

    "name": "Princess of Wands",
    "element": "Fire",
    "shortDescription": "Brilliance, beauty, courage, force. Superficial, threatrical, unstable, domineering.",
    "longDescription": "The Princess of Wands represents the Earth in the element of Fire, far from the Queen's depth and the Prince's Air. She's the Fire's daughter, with all the flaming energy of the Knight, unaffected from deeper emotions. The only heritage from her mother is the good memory for insultings and the thirst for revenge. Though, while dancing in the flames, the Princess of Wands has her own beauty with her unsatiable hunger for life and her endless, powerful energies. Her passion is hot, explosive and fast, burning down the object of desire and forgetting about it as soon as a new one comes in sight. Almost like Bizet's Carmen, she's irresistable in her seductive carelessness, in all her lust and anima. At the shadow side, the Princess of Wands can lack all true warmth of the heart, faithless and self-indulgent, theatralic and unable to feel real compassion and understanding. At the worst, she can sink down in pure greed and cruelty, too cold and numbed to recognize the own emotional poverty and emptiness."
